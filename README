*     Summary:    TestBuddy is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting 
*                 students with standardized testing. We offer a wealth of free 
*                 resources that were previously inaccessible to many due to 
*                 financial constraints. Our mission is to foster a supportive 
*                 community where students can easily find peers—test buddies—to 
*                 collaborate with, making test preparation less daunting 
*                 and more accessible for everyone.

Thank you to Tufts University and JumboCode for hosting this event. It presented us 
with a unique opportunity to contribute positively to society and education. 
Despite having just two days, we successfully created a prototype of the website. 
The JumboCode staff offered invaluable inspiration and technical guidance. 
We thoroughly enjoyed dedicating time to coding projects of our own interest, 
beyond the usual scope of homework and assignments.

Given the resurgence in SAT participation to near pre-pandemic levels, as reported by 
Education Week, it's evident that standardized tests like the SAT continue to play 
a pivotal role in college admissions. This trend underscores the importance of 
platforms like TestBuddy, which aims to democratize access to test preparation 
resources. Despite some institutions adopting test-optional policies, the SAT 
remains integral to the college application process for many students.

The growing number of test-takers, coupled with the persistent achievement gap 
influenced by socioeconomic factors, highlights the need for accessible educational 
support. TestBuddy addresses this by offering free resources, leveling the playing 
field for students from diverse backgrounds. As SAT scores still reflect disparities 
in educational opportunity, initiatives us become essential in bridging 
these gaps, providing all students with the tools needed to excel.
